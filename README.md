# NetPyRogue
NetPyRouge is a rouge-like multiplayer-based game. It's networking capabilities are based on the PodSixNet library.

Requirements for running this game:

- **Python 3.4**+ (because of e.g. Enums which were implemented in Python 3.4, and for some reason Python 3.7 doesn't work because of the shipped PodSixNet Library, I guess that has to be fixed at some point)
- The PodSixNet library correctly installed on your system (see [PodSixNet at GitHub](https://github.com/chr15m/PodSixNet/tree/python3))

**Ongoing development happens only at https://github.com/Gatgeagent/netpyrogue**
